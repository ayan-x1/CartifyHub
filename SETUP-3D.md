# 3D Setup Guide

## Current Issue
The error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ReactCurrentOwner')` occurs because:
1. React Three Fiber v8 is not compatible with React 19
2. The packages need to be updated to compatible versions

## Solution Steps

### 1. Install Updated Packages
Run this command to install the compatible versions:

```bash
npm install @react-three/fiber@^9.0.0 @react-three/drei@^9.99.0 three@^0.171.0
```

### 2. After Installation
Once the packages are installed, you can replace the fallback in `components/Hero3D.tsx` with the actual 3D component.

### 3. Alternative: Use Current Fallback
The current setup will work without 3D - it shows a nice fallback UI that doesn't break the app.

## Why This Happened
- React 19 introduced breaking changes
- React Three Fiber v8 doesn't support React 19
- The packages need to be updated to v9+ for compatibility

## Current Status
‚úÖ App works with fallback UI
‚è≥ 3D functionality pending package installation
üîß Error handling implemented
